**NewsApp Android Project**

This is an Android project built using Kotlin to create a simple and efficient news app. It demonstrates the use of `RecyclerView` to display a list of news articles, each with a heading and an associated image. The project incorporates modern Android development practices, such as using `ConstraintLayout`, `RecyclerView`, and data-binding for creating an intuitive UI.

Key Features:
1. **RecyclerView Implementation**: A `RecyclerView` is used to display a vertically scrollable list of news items, each containing a headline and an image.
2. **Edge-to-Edge UI**: The app enables edge-to-edge screen support to maximize the display area, ensuring the content is displayed with full screen utilization.
3. **Dynamic Data Handling**: The app dynamically populates a list of news articles, where each article has a headline and an image.
4. **Image Handling**: Each news item in the list is accompanied by an image, which is displayed using `ImageView` and bound to the data using Kotlin.

**Folder Structure**:
- `MainActivity.kt`: The main activity where the `RecyclerView` and data binding are set up.
- `Myadapter.kt`: Adapter class that binds the data to each `RecyclerView` item.
- `CustomBinding.xml`: XML layout for each item in the `RecyclerView`, which includes an image and a text view.
- `ActivityMainBinding.xml`: Layout file that contains the `RecyclerView` and ensures edge-to-edge support.
- `Drawable Resources`: Images used for the news items.

This repository serves as a practical demonstration of how to build a basic news application with Android using modern design principles and efficient UI components. You can use this as a base project and extend it to include more features such as loading news from an API, saving news articles for offline use, etc.

# NewsApp Android Project

## Overview
The NewsApp is a simple Android application that displays a list of news articles. Each article is presented with a headline and an associated image. This app uses a `RecyclerView` to display the articles and utilizes modern Android practices such as data binding, `ConstraintLayout`, and edge-to-edge UI for a smooth user experience.

## Features
- **RecyclerView**: Displays news articles in a scrollable list.
- **Dynamic Data**: Articles are dynamically populated into the list, each containing a headline and an image.
- **Edge-to-Edge Support**: The app takes advantage of edge-to-edge support to maximize screen space.
- **Image Display**: Each news item has a related image shown alongside the headline.

## Requirements
- Android Studio with Kotlin support.
- Android 6.0 (API level 23) or higher.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository**:
